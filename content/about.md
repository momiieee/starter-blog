Hi! My name is Momina Abid, and I recently graduated from Lahore University of Management Sciences, majoring in Economics & Politics, and minoring in Psychology.

The first thing I did after I got my degree, quite literally, was join Teach for Pakistan as a Fellow. There are 40 of us, selected this year, and about 15 others who were selected last year. For 6 weeks, all of us were put through what was most likely one of the most intensive and rigorous teacher training programs in the country.

Against all odds, I survived. I will talk about the great struggles of moving and settling into a new city, starting your first job, making new friends, loneliness, depression, and crippling self-doubt later. But little did I know, the worst was far from over.

I am now placed in an all-girls goverment school in a village that most people have never heard of and never will. It is almost an hour's commute to get to the school and back. For the next two years, I am going to teach English and Social Studies to Grade 3 and 4, and each of my class has approximately 50 students.

Fun fact: Only 1 out of these 100 students of mine can put together a grammatically correct sentence without any spelling errors.

So how am I going to possibly teach them to not only read and write, but also to understand what they are being taught, and take those skills forward in life?

Come with me, as I walk/run/crawl through the next two years, trying to make the most of my time, efforts, and abilities, and make my girls grow into strong, fearless, confident, and independent women.
